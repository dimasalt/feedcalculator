## Cattle Feed Calculator

Free feed calculator for raising baby calves and finishing cattle up to 1000 lbs weight. 

This software is working prototype and is currently in active development. Eventually more cattle types will be added as well as
calculations for other farm animals.



### To Do List

Still need to add calculations for DM (Dry Matter).

Need to fix calculations floating points.

Need to add user Token reading and updating from API.

Will be replacing Mysql2 and store procedure with Prisma ORM.

Need to make application responsive. Right now works only on large screens.

Code needs a further refactoring.

Some presentation code needs to be split into components (like calculation result displays and validation messages).

Missing 404 page.

Missing normal error handling.

Better front end and desing.

Move error messaging into separate control.

Prevent duplicates in selected feeds.


<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
